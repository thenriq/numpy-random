    "**NumPy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more."

    "**Numpy** has several advantages over Python lists, such as:\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: NumPy arrays are fixed-length arrays, while python has lists that are extensible;\n",
    "- **Speed**: NumPy uses under-the-hood optimizations such as transposing and chunked multiplications; the operations are vectorized so that the looped operations are performed much faster\n",
    "- **Filtering**: A pretty handy trick that can be used to separate data based on some condition or the label, which is very useful in data analytics and machine learning. Source: [Advantages of using NumPy over Python Lists](https://medium.com/swlh/why-use-numpy-d06c573fbcda)"
