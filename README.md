#### About this project:

All investigation made can be found into the jupyter notebook called *numpy-random.ipynb*.

In this project, we will talk about the Numpy.random package. It will explain the use of this package, covering the following points:
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. 
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions. 
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

In order to run this notebook, you will need to install Python.

It can be done from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Once installed, open a command line and type:
`jupyter notebook`
